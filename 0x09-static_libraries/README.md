0x09-static_libraries

This project helps us to understand what a static library is, how it works, how to create it and how to use it with the usage of commands like ranlib, ar, nm.

0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions given in main.h file.

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
